# Bash Profile

I'm using the wonderful [.bash_profile](https://gist.github.com/natelandau/10654137) curated by @natelandau. I'm also using the [Flat UI Terminal Theme by ](https://dribbble.com/shots/1021755-Flat-UI-Terminal-Theme) by Ahmet SÃ¼lek

1. Add as ~/.bash_profile
2. Install homebrew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
3. `brew install git`
4. `brew install bash-completion`
